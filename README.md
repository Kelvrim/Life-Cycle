# LifeCycle

**LifeCycle is a cellular automata** based heavily on the late John H Conway's Game of Life. A cellular automata is a
mathematical model of cells with only two states: alive or dead, on or off, 1 or 0, etc. The state of each cell 
is updated in discrete time steps based on the state of its immediate neighbors. 

Most cellular automata models could barely be described as a game at all, but many ascribe to the term "0 player game."
The idea is that once there are some cells on the grid, life takes off! What's interesting about a lot of cellular automata
rulesets (including Conways Game of Life) are technically undecidable. This means that although you can intuit infinite loops and behaviour of cells decently well,
there is no way to prove it mathematically. What I mean specifically: given an initial pattern and a later pattern, 
no algorithm exists that can tell whether the later pattern is ever going to appear.

For more information, strongly consider reading up on [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton). There's a
lot of really cool stuff, including that Conways Game of Life is Turing Complete!

On another note, to keep this respectful to Conway, he actually really hated his Game of Life. He felt strongly that it's popularity
distracted people from his more impactful and interesting work. So, if you love mathematics and have the time, read more about 
his other works [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway)


## Current Features

- Graphical simulation of up to five cellular automata rulesets, obviously including Conways Game of Life

- Pause and play the simulation
- Cells change color depending on how old they are


## Later down the road

- Zooming and scrolling capabilities
- Brushes containing preset patterns
- Prettier color changing
- Prettier buttons
- More buttons!
- Importing custom rules


## REALLY Later down the road
- 3D automata!
