# Game of Life 

This is (yet another) Game of Life clone. For now it'll be nothing spectacular, but the scale will hopeully grow more impressive as development goes on.


## Minimum Viable Product

While this isn't really a product per say, the philosophy still applies. Below is a list of the minimum required features
before I'm willing to make this repo public. They should (obviously) be prioritized over more lofty changes:

- A unique name. Without one, it'll look too much like every other resume builder project.
- A GUI. More specifically:
  - The app opening in its own window (using FlatLaf)
  - Relevant information being displayed in the corner (generation number, population, etc)
  - Pause/ Play buttons
  - 'Drawing' capabilities (choosing which cells are alive)
- Actual graphics (not X's and O's being printed to the system lol
- Relatively clean code


## Later down the road

Once we have our MVP, we can focus on this (probably constantly growing list) of features:
- Color selection
- Alternate rulesets (whoops I worked on this one a little already)
  - Highlife
  - Antilife 
- Alternate graphing:
  - Hexagonal
  - 3D
